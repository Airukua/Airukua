# Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently an MSc Artificial Intelligence student at the **University of Southampton** with a strong interest in **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)**, particularly in preserving regional languages through translation technology. Here's a bit about my journey so far:

## 🎓 Academic Background
I'm actively involved in my studies, attending seminars, workshops, group discussions, and field study visits. My academic work has primarily focused on group and individual assignments, and I'm looking forward to starting my research in **Indonesian to Geser translation** soon, as part of my goal to preserve almost-extinct languages through modern tech.

## 🔬 Research Interests
- **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)**: I'm fascinated by how AI can be leveraged to bridge language gaps, especially in under-resourced languages.
- **Language Preservation**: My aim is to help preserve endangered languages, such as Geser, by creating effective translation models.
  
## 🛠 Skills
- Programming: Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Pascal, PHP
- Web Framework : ReactJS, Bootstrap, tailwindcss
- AI & Machine Learning: Neural Networks, Machine Translation basics
- Data Processing & Analysis
- Collaboration & Communication: Through various academic projects and group discussions

## 🌱 What's Next?
I'm currently working under the guidance of my Academic Advisor, preparing to dive deeper into my research and contribute to the field of machine translation. 

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate, discuss, or just say hi!
